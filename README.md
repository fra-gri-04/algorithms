# fragri library

Hi everyone, I will be implementing algorithms and data structures that I find somewhat interesting and upload them here.

I'm implementing the most common algorithms, in order to test the executions' time.

You can find them [here](fragri-library/benchmarking).

I'm implementing by hand useful data structures

You can find them [here](fragri-library/dataStructures).

## Benchmarking

Inside the [inspector folder](fragri-library/src/it/benchmarking/inspector/) you'll find a benchmarking script to test the algorithms present in the [modules folder](fragri-library/src/it/benchmarking/modules/).

It will execute a selected algorithm `n` times with random generated input (arrays will have the same lengths, but different contents).

## Computer Science

Inside the [computer-science](computer-science/) folder you'll find my implementations of some execises of computer science classes, some in [java](computer-science/java/) and some in [golang](computer-science/go).
