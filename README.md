# Algorithms!
Hi everyone, I will be implementing algorithms that I find somewhat interesting and upload them here.

The main collection will be in the [Java Repo](java/), where I'm developing a benchmarking script to test the algorithms present in the [modules folder](java/src/it/modules/).

It will execute a selected algorithm `n` times with random generated input (arrays will have the same lengths, but different contents).

Inside the [go folder](go/) I'll upload the exercises of my computer science classes.
